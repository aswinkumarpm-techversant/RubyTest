Read the following nursery rhyme from a file into another file that is saved with a timestamp of creation:

“Mary had a little lamb
Little lamb, little lamb
Mary had a little lamb
Its fleece was white as snow
And everywhere that Mary went
Mary went, Mary went
Everywhere @# that Mary went
The lamb was sure to go

He followed her to school one day
School one day, ^&^school one day
He followed her to school one day
Which was #$%against the rule
It made the children laugh and play
Laugh and play, laugh &*and play
It made the children laugh and play
To see a lamb at school”

Use the iterators: collect and map for looping.
Print out the special characters found in the file by implementing a custom exception.
Calculate the number of duplicate occurrences of an alphabet and record it into another file as a hash.
The filename with a timestamp in it’s name (the format of the timestamp date should be “anyfilename_22ndSep202009:52”.
Use iterator “inject” to calculate the sum total of duplicate occurrences.
